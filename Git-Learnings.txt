some basic linux commands:
		cd <directoryname> -to change the directory
		ls -to list all the files and folders in  the pwd

Git basic commands:

		Commands for Tracked files:
				git ls-files to see all the files that are being tracked by the git	
				git commit -am to add and commit the modified file at once(in single command)
		Editing file:
				Edit the file in the editor and add the modified changes to the staging area
				Again edit the same file and check the git status command..git shows both that the file needs to be commited from staging area 
				and also the changes that need to be added to the staging area
		Recursive adding:
				git add . this will add all the files recursively into the staging area 
		Backout Changes:
				git reset HEAD <filename> to remove the modified file from the git staging area
				git restore <filename> to remove the changes made in the file(revert back the file to the last commited version)
		Rename and moving a file:
		        git mv <oldfilename> <newFilename> this will rename the file.
		Deleting files:
		        git rm <filename> to delete the file from the git
		History:
				git log to look at the pervious commits
				git log --abbrev-commit to shorten the commit id
				git log --oneline --graph --decorate will display the history in a different manner
				git log --since="3 days ago" to display log date wise
				git log --<filename> to display log for the specific file
				git log --follow --<path of the file> log for the renamed files
		Alias command:
		We can set our own alias git command
		set the alias in the git global config file
		git log --all --graph --decorate --online to display the log history in a more readable form
